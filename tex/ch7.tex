This dissertation seeks to define the problem of buffer vessel selection in
bioprocessing facility design.
It succeeded in modelling the problem mathematically, as a series of linear
constraints on binary and real variables.
The problem was then implemented such that it can be solved using one of a
range of mixed-integer linear programming packages.
Equipment time utilisation plots were designed to visualise the results.
The models were trialled on both random and real-world data and found to be
robust.
The complexity of the models and time taken for solution were investigated.
Scope for further work was outlined in terms of some additional features or
constraints that could be added to the model.
It is hoped that the work can contribute to the fields of engineering design
and process optimisation and in particular that the code may be used on future
design projects to aid rapid and accurate early-stage design of large-scale
bioprocessing facilities.
