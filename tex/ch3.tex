\section{Introduction}\label{S.intro3}
This chapter will outline the requirements for input data.
It will also outline what form the output data and metrics should take.

For modelling a single process, a typical data-set consists of three distinct
files.
The first file is a table of data relating to the available selection of
vessels.
The second file is a table of data relating to parameters specific
to each buffer.
The third file comprises a collection of global parameters
that apply to all vessels and/or buffers.

One particular example, based on some randomly generated data, is used
throughout this chapter to illustrate the relevant data formats.

\section{Vessel Data}\label{S.vesseldata}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Vessel data for random example}
    \label{tbl.vessel}
    \begin{tabular}{l | r | r}
        names & volumes & costs\\
        & $V_{m}$ (l) & $c_{m}$ (--)\\\hline
        \SI{1000}{\litre} & \SI{1000.0}{} & \SI{63.10}{}\\
        \SI{2000}{\litre} & \SI{2000.0}{} & \SI{95.64}{}\\
        \SI{3000}{\litre} & \SI{3000.0}{} & \SI{121.98}{}\\
        \SI{4000}{\litre} & \SI{4000.0}{} & \SI{144.96}{}\\
        \SI{5000}{\litre} & \SI{5000.0}{} & \SI{165.72}{}\\
        \SI{6000}{\litre} & \SI{6000.0}{} & \SI{184.88}{}\\
        \SI{8000}{\litre} & \SI{8000.0}{} & \SI{219.71}{}\\
        \SI{10000}{\litre} & \SI{10000.0}{} & \SI{251.19}{}\\
        \SI{12000}{\litre} & \SI{12000.0}{} & \SI{280.83}{}\\
        \SI{16000}{\litre} & \SI{16000.0}{} & \SI{333.02}{}\\
        \SI{18000}{\litre} & \SI{18000.0}{} & \SI{357.41}{}\\
        \SI{20000}{\litre} & \SI{20000.0}{} & \SI{380.73}{}\\
        \SI{22000}{\litre} & \SI{22000.0}{} & \SI{403.14}{}\\
        \SI{25000}{\litre} & \SI{25000.0}{} & \SI{435.28}{}\\
        \SI{30000}{\litre} & \SI{30000.0}{} & \SI{485.59}{}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The vessel data will contain several parameters for each available vessel size,
$m \in M$.
A vessel data-set will contain entries for $\mathcal{M}$ vessel sizes:
\begin{equation}
    m \in M; \quad M = \left\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, m, \ldots, \left(
    \mathcal{M} - 1 \right) \right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M} = |M|
\end{equation}

Typically, when designing a large-scale production facility, buffer preparation
vessel volumes range from \SI{1000}{\litre} to \SI{30000}{\litre}.

When ordering such a vessel, the stated size of the vessel is usually a nominal
volume, which will differ from the liquid fill volume and may also differ from
the maximum working volume.
It is usual to round the stated or nominal volume to the nearest thousand
litres.

For the purposes of this study, it is assumed that, for each vessel $m \in M$,
the specified vessel volume, $V_{m}$ is the maximum working volume (in litres)
of the vessel, which is taken to be the maximum volume of buffer which can be
prepared in that vessel.

Vessels will also have a minimum working volume.
It is usual to assume a minimum fill ratio of about 30\% of the vessel volume.
This limitation arises due to the minimum agitation volume of the impeller in
the vessel.
For the purposes of this simulation, the minimum fill ratio is a global
parameter.
It may be possible to specify a value of minimum fill ratio for every vessel
size, but this level of detail is typically neither required nor available.

For each vessel, $m \in M$, a (relative) cost, $c_{m}$, must also be defined.
Note that absolute costs are not required to find the vessel selection that
minimises costs.
Vessel costs tend not to scale linearly with volume.

Sample vessel data are given in \hyperref[tbl.vessel]{Table \ref*{tbl.vessel}}.
In this table, the cost value for each vessel size has been estimated by
raising the vessel volume (in litres) to a power of 0.6 and rounding to two
decimal places.
Note that the vessel volumes, $V_{m}$, are equal to the nominal volumes
indicated in the `names' column.  The contents of the `names' column are
treated as identifiers and are not used in any calculation.
It is not uncommmon to have values of $V_{m}$ slightly larger than their
respective named (nominal) volumes; a vessel with a nominal volume of e.g.\
\SI{1000}{\litre} will be capable of holding at least \SI{1000}{\litre}, with
the precise maximum working volume being a function of the vessel geometry.

\section{Buffer Data}\label{S.bufferdata}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Buffer data for random example}
    \label{tbl.buffer}
    \begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c}
        names & required volumes & use start times & use durations\\
        & $U_{n}$ (l) & $t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*}$ (h) 
        & $\Delta t_{\mathit{USE},n}$
        (h)\\ \hline
        \text{Buffer \#1} & \SI{24427.13}{} & \SI{76.23}{} & \SI{20.56}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#2} & \SI{5487.29}{} & \SI{0.21}{} & \SI{49.77}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#3} & \SI{2588.36}{} & \SI{25.78}{} & \SI{24.56}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#4} & \SI{7102.05}{} & \SI{46.79}{} & \SI{27.77}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#5} & \SI{1020.87}{} & \SI{87.7}{} & \SI{36.58}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#6} & \SI{19508.79}{} & \SI{35.52}{} & \SI{58.53}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#7} & \SI{23073.55}{} & \SI{42.26}{} & \SI{39.71}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#8} & \SI{25454.10}{} & \SI{48.38}{} & \SI{43.47}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#9} & \SI{24088.67}{} & \SI{4.18}{} & \SI{55.41}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#10} & \SI{3172.46}{} & \SI{48.31}{} & \SI{23.27}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#11} & \SI{24752.71}{} & \SI{76.38}{} & \SI{45.80}{}\\
        \text{Buffer \#12} & \SI{13445.31}{} & \SI{73.93}{} & \SI{34.25}{}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The buffer data will contain several parameters for each buffer to be prepared,
$n \in N$.
A buffer data-set will contain entries for $\mathcal{N}$ buffers:
\begin{equation}
    n \in N; \quad N = \left\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n, \ldots, \left(
    \mathcal{N} - 1 \right) \right\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{N} = |N|
\end{equation}
For each buffer, $n \in N$, the data-set will contain, at a minimum, its
required preparation volume (in litres), $U_{n}$.

If nothing was known about the scheduling of the production process, a simple
simulation could be carried out without scheduling.
Such a simulation would assume a fixed duration for all operations in the
preparation procedure and would require knowledge of the cycle time and an
additional parameter representing the maximum utilisation ratio of the
preparation vessels (see \hyperref[S.parameters]{Section \ref*{S.parameters}}).

For a complete model, with scheduling, we also need to know when each buffer
is first required by the process, and the duration for which it is required.

Sample buffer data are given in \hyperref[tbl.buffer]{Table \ref*{tbl.buffer}}.
\hyperref[fig.explanatory]{Figure \ref*{fig.explanatory}} gives an overview of
data and parameters related to scheduling, which are detailed in the reaminder
of this section and in \hyperref[S.parameters]{Section \ref*{S.parameters}}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.55]{./figures/explanatory.pdf}
    \caption{Equipment time utilisation for a single buffer}
    \label{fig.explanatory}
\end{figure}

For each buffer, $n \in N$, its (unnormalised) time of first use,
$t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*}$, is the time when the process draws the first drop of
buffer from its hold vessel.
This time is relative to some batch datum, e.g.\ the start of the batch or the
start of downstream processing.
The choice of datum is unimportant once it is consistently used. 
The model deals with steady-state processing, so we are interested in a 
single-cycle window.
As a result, we want to normalise $t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*}$ with respect to the
cycle time, $T$.
Accordingly, we define:
\begin{equation}
    t_{\mathit{USE},n} = t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*} \enspace \text{mod} \enspace 
    T \quad \forall n \in N
\end{equation}
Note that the random data generator used to produce the data in 
\hyperref[tbl.buffer]{Table \ref*{tbl.buffer}} produces values for 
$t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*}$ that are already normalised, but for the real-world
examples discussed in \hyperref[C.results]{Chapter \ref*{C.results}}, 
$t_{\mathit{USE},n}^{*}$ may be unnormalised.

For each buffer, $n \in N$, its duration of first use,
$\Delta t_{\mathit{USE},n}$, is the duration from when the process draws the
first drop of buffer from its hold vessel to when it finishes drawing the last
drop of buffer from the same vessel.
Note that a process may draw buffer discontinuously from a hold vessel, e.g.\ a
cleaning buffer may be drawn from its hold vessel for a few minutes at the end
of a chromatography procedure and may not be required again until near the end
of another chromatography procedure a day or two later, but may not be required
at all in the intervening period.
Note the use of the general convention that \emph{durations} are denoted by
$\Delta t$, whereas \emph{times} (relative to some datum) are denoted by $t$.
It is assumed that all times and durations are in hours.

For each buffer, $n$, $\Delta t_{\mathit{USE},n}$ must be sufficiently less
than the cycle time so that there is opportunity to \emph{turn around} its hold
vessel (i.e.\ sufficient time must exist after use of the buffer to clean and
sterilise the vessel, receive the subsequent batch of buffer and hold for a
sufficient duration before use of that buffer is required by the subsequent
batch).

\section{Parameters}\label{S.parameters}

In addition to the buffer-specific and vessel-specific data detailed above,
some global parameters are required to specify the problem.
For the random example, these parameters are tabulated in
\hyperref[tbl.parameters]{Table \ref*{tbl.parameters}} and are described in
more detail hereafter.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Global parameters for random example}
    \label{tbl.parameters}
    \begin{tabular}{l | l | r | c}
        symbol & short description & value & unit\\ \hline
        $T$ & process cycle time & 96.0 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,PRE}}$ & prep pre duration & 12.0 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,POST}}$ & prep post duration & 1.5 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{TRANSFER}}$ & transfer duration & 2.0 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,PRE}}$ & hold pre duration & 8.0 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,POST}}$ & hold post duration & 1.5 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,MIN}}$ & minimum hold duration & 12.0 & h\\
        $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,MAX}}$ & maximum hold duration & 60.0 & h\\
        $f_{\mathit{MINFILL}}$ & minimum fill ratio & 0.3 & --\\
        $f_{\mathit{UTIL}}$ & maximum utilisation ratio & 0.8 & --\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first parameter sepcified is the cycle time, $T$.  We are concerned
with the steady-state operation of the process, so the cycle time can be
thought of as the duration from some fixed point in one batch to the same
fixed point in the subsequent batch.
The cycle time is typically some multiple of 24 hours.
This is for reasons of operability; it is easier for staff if a given task
occurs at the same time of the day for each batch.
Note that it is not our objective to seek to minimise the cycle time.
A well-designed facility should be bottlenecked at the production bioreactor,
so the cycle time is a function of the production process and not the buffer
preparation area.

In the model, the preparation and hold procedures are both broken into a number
of operations.
The durations of most of these operations are specified as global parameters.
It is unlikely that detailed timings will be available at the early stages of
design, so specifying some conservative global parameters provides a model that
is easy to comprehend and validate.
In reality, operations such as filling a vessel with water will scale with
buffer bolume and operations such as cooldown of a vessel after steaming will
scale with vessel volume.
This degree of granularity could be added as a future model enhancement.

The following durations are specified as global parameters:

The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,PRE}}$ is the duration of all operations
in the preparation procedure prior to the transfer of buffer to the buffer hold
vessel.  
This may include pressure testing, steam-in-place (SIP) and cooldown, although
these tasks are not always carried out on preparation vessels.
The period will include the charging of WFI, the charging of other liquids
and/or solids, and time for mixing the buffer.
It may also include some time for sampling or testing and adjustment of the
buffer.

The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,POST}}$ is the duration of all operations
in the preparation procedure that take place after the transfer of the buffer
to the buffer hold vessel is complete.
This is typically just comprised of the clean-in-place (CIP) of the vessel.
CIP involves a separate piece of equipment, the CIP skid, which circulates
cleaning fluids (detergents and/or acids, bases) through the vessel and some of
its attached pipework.

The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,POST}}$ is the duration of the transfer
of buffer from the preparation vessel to the hold vessel, via a sterile filter.
Although this varies with the buffer volume, the relationship is not that
straightforward.
As buffer and vessel volumes increase, a change in pipe diameter or pump size
may be appropriate, giving large step changes to the transfer duration.
Accordingly, a conservative global parameter for transfer duration is
appropriate for early-stage design.

The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,PRE}}$ is the duration of all operations
in the hold procedure prior to the commencement of receipt of buffer from the
preparation vessel.
This typically includes pressure testing, SIP and cooldown.

The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,POST}}$ is the duration of all operations
in the hold procedure that take place after the last use of buffer by the
process is complete.
Like $\Delta t_{\mathit{PREP,POST}}$, this is primarily comprised of a CIP of
the respective vessel.

Looking at \hyperref[fig.explanatory]{Figure \ref*{fig.explanatory}}, the one
symbol not yet mentioned is the buffer hold duration, $\boldsymbol{z}_{n}$.
Note that this is a decision variable, and not a parameter; it is discussed in
more detail in \hyperref[C.methodology]{Chapter \ref*{C.methodology}}.
The buffer hold duration is the duration that spans from the end of the
transfer into the buffer hold vessel until the start of the first use of the
buffer by the process.
As will be described in 
\hyperref[C.methodology]{Chapter \ref*{C.methodology}},
we place some bounds on this duration and express these bounds as a pair of
global parameters.
The parameter $\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,MIN}}$ defines the minimum allowabe
duration of the buffer hold operation.
In practice, the operators of a plant do not want to schedule buffer
preparations so that the transfer is complete moments before the buffer is
required by the process, as any delays at this stage could imapct production.
A value, typically in the range of several hours to one day, can be specified
to ensure that buffers are prepared with some flexibility to handle delays.
At the other end of the scale, buffers may expire and the global variable 
$\Delta t_{\mathit{HOLD,MIN}}$ is defined to set a maximum allowable hold
duration.

When selecting a vessel, a minimum fill ratio, $f_{\mathit{MINFILL}}$ is
defined to ensure that a vessel isn't selected that is far too big for the
buffer being prepared. The rationale for this was mentioned in
\hyperref[S.vesseldata]{Section \ref*{S.vesseldata}}.

Finally, the utilisation ratio, $f_{\mathit{UTIL}}$, places an upper limit on
how busy a preparation vessel is allowed to be.
In the absence of detailed buffer scheduling information, this may represent an
`engineering factor' to account for unforseeable scheduling clashes.
If detailed scheduling information is available, the ratio can be set to unity
to effectively remove its influence as a constraint, or the ratio could be
maintained at some value less than one to allow for some overhead in the
design.

\section{Output Data}\label{S.outputdata}

This section describes the format of the outputs generated by the model, rather
than the values of the results themselves, which are discussed in detail in 
\hyperref[C.results]{Chapter \ref*{C.results}}.

The primary aim is to generate a list of the required preparation volumes.
For the random example used in this chapter, solution of the model yields
the results in \hyperref[tbl.reqvessels]{Table \ref*{tbl.reqvessels}}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Required preparation vessels for random example}
    \label{tbl.reqvessels}
    \begin{tabular}{r}
        vessel size\\ \hline
        \SI{2000}{\litre}\\
        \SI{8000}{\litre}\\
        \SI{25000}{\litre}\\
        \SI{30000}{\litre}\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

While \hyperref[tbl.reqvessels]{Table \ref*{tbl.reqvessels}} gives the
essential information allowing the buffer preparation area to be sized and
costed, it may be more instructive to return a matrix showing where each buffer
is to be prepared. 
\hyperref[tbl.bvmatrix]{Table \ref*{tbl.bvmatrix}} shows \emph{one possible}
vessel assignment for the random example.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Buffer / vessel matrix for random example}
    \label{tbl.bvmatrix}
    \begin{tabular}{l | c | c | c | c }
        & \SI{2000}{\litre} & \SI{8000}{\litre} & \SI{25000}{\litre} &
        \SI{30000}{\litre}\\ \hline
        Buffer \#1  & & & $\bullet$ & \\
        Buffer \#2  & & $\bullet$ & & \\
        Buffer \#3  & & $\bullet$ & & \\
        Buffer \#4  & & $\bullet$ & & \\
        Buffer \#5  & $\bullet$ & & & \\
        Buffer \#6  & & & $\bullet$ & \\
        Buffer \#7  & & & & $\bullet$ \\
        Buffer \#8  & & & & $\bullet$ \\
        Buffer \#9  & & & & $\bullet$ \\
        Buffer \#10 & & $\bullet$ & & \\
        Buffer \#11 & & & $\bullet$ & \\
        Buffer \#12 & & & $\bullet$ & \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note that the existence of more than one feasible version of 
\hyperref[tbl.reqvessels]{Table \ref*{tbl.reqvessels}} is unlikely for a given
data-set, especially if vessel cost scales non-lineraly with vessel volumes.
On the other hand, many feasible versions of
\hyperref[tbl.bvmatrix]{Table \ref*{tbl.bvmatrix}} may exist; e.g.\ it may be
possible to switch the vessels in which buffers are prepared and still end up
with the same optimal vessel selection.
This phenomenon is dealt with in more detail in 
\hyperref[S.secondary]{Section \ref*{S.secondary}}.

While \hyperref[tbl.bvmatrix]{Table \ref*{tbl.bvmatrix}} does give more
information than \hyperref[tbl.reqvessels]{Table \ref*{tbl.reqvessels}},
it still doesn't visibly confirm to the reader that the solution is feasible.
An \emph{equipment time utilisation} plot provides a clear visual illustration
of a solution and displays a feasible schedule.
The explanatory plot in 
\hyperref[fig.explanatory]{Figure \ref*{fig.explanatory}} is an example of an
equipment time utilisation plot.  
An equipment time utilisation plot for the random example is shown in
\hyperref[fig.etu1]{Figure \ref*{fig.etu1}}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[angle=0,scale=0.55]{./figures/plot1.pdf}
    \caption{Equipment time utilisation for random example}
    \label{fig.etu1}
\end{figure}
Each horizontal dotted line represents a piece of equipment (preparation or
hold vessels in this case).
The presence of a bar on a dotted line indicates that the respective piece of
equipment is in use.  
The hatched bars indicate transfers, with backslash hatching representing the
transfer from the buffer preparation vessel to the buffer hold vessel and
forward-slash hatching representing the transfer of buffer from the hold vessel
to the process.
The latter is shown as a contiguous bar in the hold vessel, representing the
period from the start of the first use to the end of the last use of the buffer
in a given batch, although the demand from the process may be discontinuous.

Note that the time window shown in \hyperref[fig.etu1]{Figure \ref*{fig.etu1}}
displays a single cycle at steady-state; the next cycle and the previous cycle
would be identical.
The offest of the single-cycle window is somewhat arbitrary; the
visible window can be thought of as a cylinder that has been cut at right a
angles to its ends and flattened out.

It should be noted also that \hyperref[fig.etu1]{Figure \ref*{fig.etu1}}
does not highlight the batches to which the procedures belong.
The entire downstream process may take more than one cycle to complete, so the
window visible in the plot could be showing buffer preparation and hold
procedures from several succesive batches.

The visual output of an equipment time utilisation plot provides a useful
method for validating results.
As the model detailed in 
\hyperref[C.methodology]{Chapter \ref*{C.methodology}} was being developed,
such plots were a useful way of highlighting logical flaws or bugs in the code.
With the finished model, such plots are a useful tool for convincing
colleagues and clients that a proposed vessel selection is feasible.
