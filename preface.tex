\chapter*{Preface}

\begin{quote}
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap

Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge

Through living roots awaken in my head.

But I've no spade to follow men like them.

Between my finger and my thumb

The squat pen rests.

I'll dig with it.

\hspace{2cm}--- Seamus Heaney, \emph{Digging}
