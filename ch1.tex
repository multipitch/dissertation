\chapter{Introduction}\label{C.intro}

\begin{quote}
If anybody calls, says the brother, tell them I'm above in Merrion Square workin at the 
quateernyuns, says he, and take any message.  There does be other lads in the same house 
doing sums with the brother.  The brother does be teachin them sums.  He does be puttin 
them right about the sums and the quateernyuns.

\textit{Indeed.} 

I do believe the brother's makin a good thing out of the sums and the quateernyuns.  Your 
men couldn't offer him less than five bob an hour and I'm certain sure he gets his tea 
thrown in.

\textit{That is a desirable perquisite.} 

Because do you know, the brother won't starve.  The brother looks after Number Wan. 
Matteradamn what he's at, it has to stop when the grubsteaks is on the table.  The brother's 
very particular about that.

\textit{Your relative is versed in the science of living.} 

Begob the sums and the quateernyuns is quickly shoved aside when the alarm for grub is sounded 
and all hands is piped to the table.  The brother thinks there's a time for everything.

\section{Background}\label{S.intro1}

We begin by \ldots

\subsection{Particular Background}\label{SS.xyz}

Here are some examples of indexing: Newton's algorithm\index{Newton's algorithm}\index{algorithm!Newton} is 
still widely used, with modifications.  

Note that the \verb|\index{algorithm!Newton}| gives an index subentry for Newton under the entry for algorithm.
The index entries and/or their page numbers can be formatted using a pipe $|$ symbol in the \verb!\index{}! 
command as follows:

\begin{defn}
The strictest definition of an \emph{algorithm}\index{algorithm@\textit{algorithm}} is: a finite set of instructions 
that can be carried out in a finite amount of time: that is, it must terminate.

These instructions must be clear and unambiguous as they are to be interpreted by a (dumb) 
machine, so we must be absolutely precise about their meaning --- mathematical logic is 
thus crucial in the design of algorithms\index{algorithm@\textbf{algorithm}}.
\end{defn}

In practice, many useful numerical ``algorithms''\index{algorithm|textbf} that we study may get closer and closer 
to the desired solution without reaching it in a finite time.  So, typically, we accept as an 
``algorithm''\index{algorithm|textit} a finite set of instructions that will get within any desired tolerance 
of the true solution in a finite time.
If the algorithm is stochastic (involves probability, as many modern ones do) the term 
``metaheuristic''\index{metaheuristic|textbf} is sometimes used.

In particular, you could use the \verb|\index{algorithm@\textit{algorithm}}| or \verb!\index{algorithm|\textbf}! to
indicate the first or most important occurrence in the text of the term ``algorithm'', etc.

Some minor examples of other things indexing can do:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can handle accented words as in \'ecole\index{ecole@\'ecole}: the index entry appears in the correct 
order under E, as desired;
\item You can put in cross-references, as in 

Are metaheuristics\index{metaheuristic|see{algorithm}} really algorithms\index{algorithm|seealso{metaheuristic}}?
\end{itemize}

Note: when you LaTeX your file \texttt{myfile.tex}, a file \texttt{myfile.idx} is produced by \verb|\makeindex|; 
this file must be sorted by an operating system command, e.g.,

\texttt{makeindex myfile} 

This generated a \emph{sorted} index file \texttt{myfile.ind}.  Running LaTeX one more time gets the index printed 
in the right place by \verb|\printindex|.

Here is a dummy theorem to show how to reference notation:
\begin{thm}\label{Th.FF.fte.field}
Let $\FF_q$ be a finite field of $q$ elements.  Then $q$ is a power of some prime number $p$.
\end{thm}
