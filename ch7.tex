would want to take it by degrees with rulers and cosines and familiar other instruments and 
then at the wind-up not believe what you had proved at all.  If that happened you would have

exactly delineated from Hall and Knight's Algebra and then go on again from that particular 
place till you had the whole pancake properly believed and not have bits of it half-believed 
or a doubt in your head hurting you like when you lose the stud of your shirt in the middle 
of the bed.}
