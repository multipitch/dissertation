## Optimising the design of buffer preparation in bioprocessing facilities

This dissertation introduces a method for selecting the optimal size and number
of buffer preparation vessels required for a large-scale bioprocessing
facility, given data on cycle time, buffer volumes, and data on when the 
buffers are required.

The problem is solved using Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP).
The model is constructed in Python, and uses the PuLP library used to interface
with MILP solver(s).

This dissertation thesis is being undertaken as part fulfilment of the 
requirements of the degree of Master of Science in Business Analytics at 
University College Dublin.
