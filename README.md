## Optimising the design of buffer preparation in bioprocessing facilities

This dissertation introduces a method for selecting the optimal size and number
of buffer preparation vessels required for a large-scale bioprocessing
facility, given data on cycle time, buffer volumes, and data on when the 
buffers are required.

The problem is solved using Mixed Integer-Linear Programming (MILP).
The model is constructed in Python, and uses the PuLP library used to interface
with MILP solver(s).
