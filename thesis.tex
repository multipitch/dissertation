%% To LaTeX (compile) your whole document, run these 4 commands in the order given (I run them from 
%% the command line on Linux or Mac OS X but you can run them from inside WinEdt or whatever you use):
%% latex  yourfilename
%% bibtex yourfilename  % NB this is the name of your LaTeX file, not your BibTeX database file!!
%% latex  yourfilename
%% latex  yourfilename
%%
%% Note: you don't need the .tex extension of yourfilename.tex (in fact giving it will confuse bibtex, 
%% though latex will understand it).  If you stick with the name thesis.tex for this file, you would use
%% latex thesis etc
%%
%% There are two approaches to where to put the supporting files (LaTeX style (package) files, etc).  Either:
%% 1. Put them all in the same directory as this file (quick and dirty); or
%% 2. Many style (package) files such as natbib.sty, lineno.sty may already be installed on your system, but if
%%    not, just download them e.g., from ctan.org, and copy them to YOURBASEDIRECTORY/texmf/tex/latex
%%    Copy the BibTeX style file mscBA.bst to YOURBASEDIRECTORY/texmf/bibtex/bst 
%% Approach 2 will make these files visible to any other LaTeX docs you produce.  Here, YOURBASEDIRECTORY is 
%% typically your home directory.

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,bibtotoc]{book} 
% or you can just use \documentclass[a4paper,12pt,bibtotoc]{amsbook}
% the bibtotoc may be needed to make your references appear in the Contents, also liststotoc etc

% Preamble

% LaTeX Packages to use
\usepackage{makeidx}
%\usepackage{showidx} % for drafts: shows in margin what will be indexed
\usepackage{amsthm,amsmath,amsfonts,amssymb,latexsym,graphicx,appendix,subfigure}
% the ams* packages provide the (very useful) LaTeX extensions from the AMS (Amer. Math. Soc.)
% latexsym provides some useful extra symbols
% graphicx gives control over image files, e.g., width, etc
% appendix gives more fine-tuned control over the appendices
% subfigure lets you put multiple figures (and tables) in a figure environment, so you can refer to them individually, e.g., Figure~6(b).
\usepackage{algorithm2e} % handles algorithms in a nice way, akin to tables and figures
\usepackage{tocloft}  % package allows you to control the design of table of contents, figures and tables.
\usepackage{natbib}   % gives more control over references and style of citation.  Has a lot of options, e.g., can use the [sectionbib] option to have multiple bibliographies in my document, listed in sections rather than chapters. Need this package for Chicago Manual of Style BibTeX referencing and the MScBA derived style 
\usepackage{lineno}   % useful for early draft, so a reviewer can list by pageno+lineno where to make changes
% Packages you may like to use
% \usepackage{fancyhdr}  % more control over contents of page headers and footers for documentclass book
% \usepackage{psfrag}  % if using eps files for images, this package lets you replace text in those images, so you can have the same font type and size in both text and images.
% \usepackage{layout} % prints an overview of all the page margins, if you include \layout
%\usepackage[sectionbib]{natbib} if using multiple bibliography files
%\usepackage{chapterbib}
%\usepackage{doublespace} % for double spacing, e.g. initial versions for correcting
%\usepackage[nottoc]{tocbibind} % puts almost everything in the Table of Contents

% include your own macro / declaration files, if any
\input{macros}
\input{declarns}

\linespread{1.25}         % spacing between lines
\parindent0pt             % no paragraph indentation
\parskip\smallskipamount  % small space between paragraphs

%\setlength{ \topmargin      }{  -1cm }
%\setlength{ \textheight     }{  24cm }
\setlength{ \textwidth      }{  14cm }
\setlength{ \oddsidemargin  }{ 1.0cm }
\setlength{ \evensidemargin }{ 1.0cm }

\numberwithin{equation}{section}  % alter this if desired
\numberwithin{figure}{chapter}    % alter this if desired

\pagestyle{plain} % just puts a page number at the bottom of each page
% If you comment out the last line's \pagestyle command, you can control the page headers as follows:
%\def\leftmark{\textsc{YourText1}}  % text to appear in header of left-hand (even numbered) pages, e.g., Chapter Title
%\def\rightmark{\textsc{YourText2}}  % text to appear in header of right-hand (odd numbered) pages, e.g., Thesis Title
%\def\leftmark{\textsc{}}  % gives empty header on left-hand (even numbered) pages
%\def\rightmark{\textsc{}}  % gives empty header on right-hand (odd numbered) pages

% If, in the output, if you find the width of numbers in the Contents, List of Figures, etc is too great
% (e.g. too close to the heading names) uncomment the following
%\setlength{\cftfignumwidth}{3em} % this allows you to control width of numbering in List of Figures
                                 % 4em, 5em etc would be even wider; you can also hardcode 2cm or similar
                                 % but units of em (width of a capital M) or ex (height of a small x) are
                                 % preferred since they vary with the font type / size used

% comment this out for your final version (where you don't want line numbers)
%\linenumbers

\makeindex % generates the index entries (unsorted: need to run makeindex from the command line to sort them)


% Use the following to only include certain chapters (it will speed up compilation of the part you 
% are currently working on, should the dissertation as a whole take excessively long to compile).

% Then the short caption appears in the list, while the long one appears in the text under your Table/Figure.

% below, the \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{List of figures} etc ensures these lists appear in the contents

% similarly to the \renewcommand{\cftchapfont}{Chapter } above, you can have the words Table or Figure appear

%% Abstract

%\begin{abstract}
\chapter*{Abstract} 
An abstract should be a very high level overview of your work.  It must contain the main ``take-away'' points of 
your work.  It must not use any acronyms or jargon, and it must be as accessible as possible to a non-specialist.  
It should describe the setting of your research: emphasising any unusual aspects; summarising the work you did 
and how you did it; and outlining your conclusions.

Thus, recalling the organising principle of seven ``angles on'' or ``aspects of'' your research:
\begin{itemize}
\item Context,
\item Gap,
\item Question,
\item What done,
\item What found,
\item Answer,
\item Significance
\end{itemize}
you could put a sentence or two on each into the abstract.

The abstract must be capable of standing alone as a short description of your work; e.g.,\ it might appear in a 
different document which abstracts out the contributions of a number of theses/papers (hence the term 
\emph{abstract}).  It typically is less than half a page in length, e.g.,\ 300--500 words.

The abstract is a very good place to put your summary of the ``thesis-so-far'': of course, it may change as 
the thesis develops and is usually one of the last things to be completed.  
%\end{abstract}

%%   List of important abbreviations (including special fonts, e.g.,\ {\tt fixed width} for program code)
 
% Bulk of thesis. line numbers in arabic numerals, 1, 2, 3, ...
\mainmatter 

\linespread{1.3} % adjust line spacing (if desired)

% \include all your chapters.  This automatically puts the material on a new page.  Recall that \chapter{} and
% \chapter*{} start a new chapter on a new odd-numbered page, but won't put extra empty pages along with \include
\include{ch1}
\include{ch2}
\include{ch3}
\include{ch4}
\include{ch5}
\include{ch6}
\include{ch7}

%%   These next two items are more or less the same (epilogue is just the Greek for afterword!)
%%   They are unlikely to be long enough to justify their own file(s) to \include

%%   Epilogue (if any)
%%   Afterword (if any)

%% Back matter (loose ends: continue arabic page numbering)
\backmatter

%%   Appendices, if any: there will almost certainly be one or more.
%%   This is where you put material which the reader may like to refer to but which might break 
%%   the train of thought in the thesis proper.  Large tables, etc might go here.
%%   You may also include program code if not too long: say a few important chunks.  But the 
%%   majority of this should just be put on the accompanying CD/DVD.
%%   \include appendix/ces as it/they will be big enough to justify its/their own ``chapter(s)''
\cleardoublepage
\appendix
\addappheadtotoc         % adds a separating entry to the TOC, saying Appendices
\noappendicestocpagenum  % ensures there is no page number after that TOC separating entry
% It may happen that the first appendix (e.g., Detailed Tables) appears before the "Appendices" line 
% in the table of contents.  If so, edit thesis.toc and move the Appendices line there above the first appendix,
% then re-run LaTeX to get the thesis.dvi file right.  You may have to repeatedly do this every time you LaTeX!

%%   Glossary of terms
%%   \include this as it may be big enough to justify its own ``chapter''
\cleardoublepage
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Glossary}
\include{glossary}

%%   Bibliography (References)
% For this, use BibTeX (invariably comes with your LaTeX installation).  BibTeX separates the form of a 
% reference from its content, just as LaTeX does for a document.  You put the content in a .bib file 
% called a BibTeX database, and tell BibTeX what style to overlay on it.
\cleardoublepage
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
\bibliographystyle{mscBA} % the BibTeX style file to use (omit the .bst suffix)
\bibliography{thesis}     % the BibTeX database file to use (omit the .bib suffix)
%
%% In the above, mscBA.bst is a BibTeX style file I developed based on the fairly standard chicago.bst.
%%
%% Below are sample journal and book entries from a .bib file.  Ensure that the key e.g., Chomsky:1965 you use 
%% in your .bib file entry is the same as you use in the \cite{Chomsky:1965} command in your LaTeX file. 
%%
%% @String{MIT = {{MIT Press}}}
%% @String{MIT:adr = {{Cambridge, Massachusetts}}}
%%
%% @Article{MetropEtAl:1953,
%%  AUTHOR =       {Metropolis, N. and A.W. Rosenbluth and M.N. Rosenbluth and A.H. Teller and E. Teller},
%%  YEAR =         {1953},
%%  TITLE =        {Equations of {S}tate Calculations by Fast Computing Machines},
%%  JOURNAL =      {Journal of Chemical Physics},
%%  VOLUME =       {21},
%%  NUMBER =       {6},
%%  PAGES =        {1087--1092}
%% }
%%
%% @Book{Chomsky:1965,
%%   Author =       {N. Chomsky},
%%   title =        {Aspects of the theory of syntax},
%%   PUBLISHER =    MIT,
%%   ADDRESS =      MIT:adr,
%%   YEAR =         1965
%% }
%%
%% Some other points (see the sample bibfile entries above for illustration):
%% - Case is unimportant for a field name: DATE, daTe and date all mean the same.
%% - You separate multiple authors by 'and', not using commas etc.
%% - Some punctuation marks in the key are OK, e.g. the colon ':' as in MetropEtAl:1953
%% - BibTeX has its own internal rules on when to change the case of capitalised text (e.g. in journal article titles).  
%%   You can override this by putting braces {} around text you want unchanged (e.g. the S in the article title above.
%% - You can define strings which will be expanded in the references, e.g., MIT and MIT:adr in the book above
%%   Don't put braces or quotes around these: if you do, they will not be expanded (will remain as MIT:adr, say)
%% - In your actual text, you can cite in two ways (note the position of parentheses):
%%   \citep{MetropEtAl:1953} for citation in parentheses, e.g.,  
%%     "In \citep{MetropEtAl:1953} it is shown that ..." appears as "In (Metropolis et al, 1953) it is shown that ..."
%%   \citet{MetropEtAl:1953} for citation in text, e.g., where the authors are the subject of the sentence:
%%     "\citet{MetropEtAl:1953} show that ..." appears as "Metropolis et al (1953) show that ..."
%% - With either \citep or \citet you can use optional arguments such as
%%     "\citep[e.g.,][pp.~12--20]{MetropEtAl:1953}" appears as "(e.g., Metropolis et al, 1953, pp.~12--20)"
